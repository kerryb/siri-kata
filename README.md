# Siri

Siri needs you to code some new features (because it's well behind Google
Assistant): addition, subtraction and a weather checker. There's no need to
implement the speech recognition, that's taken care of...

Examples: "Add 7 to 15." -> 22 "Subtract 7 from 15." -> 8 "What is the weather
at 5:30pm?" -> "sunny"

According to the weather API, it is "sunny" from (including) 6am to 6pm
(including), and "raining" the rest of the day.

// Disclaimer: Yes, those features may already exist in Siri (though probably
not).
